‚úÖ Step-by-Step Plan
1. Understand What Canvax Provides
Before translating UI, understand what Canvax Design System offers:

Components (e.g., Button, Input, Card, Tabs)

Theming (colors, spacing, typography)

Layout utilities (e.g., Grid, Stack)

Accessibility and brand compliance

üîç Goal: Map Figma elements to Canvax components wherever possible.

2. Manually Measure & Map Figma Elements
Since you can't inspect or export from Figma:

Zoom in and manually note down spacing, typography, and layout dimensions.

Use the ruler and pixel grid in Figma to estimate padding, margins, font sizes, etc.

Identify reusable elements like: header bar, sidebar, form fields, buttons, etc.

Group by layout structure: Header, Sidebar, Content Section, Modals, etc.

üõ†Ô∏è Use your browser's "full screen capture" or screenshot tools to save reference images while you code.

3. Create a Design-to-Code Mapping Template
Create a simple table or doc to translate design into code:

Figma Element	Canvax Component	Notes
Primary Button	<Button variant="primary">	Confirm size/color match
Input Field	<TextField />	Use label & helperText
Card-style box	<Paper elevation={2}> or <Card>	Add padding/margin
Page layout	<Grid> or <Box> with spacing	Responsive setup

4. Start Building Components Bottom-Up
Use atomic design principles:

Build atoms: Button, Label, InputField

Then molecules: Search bar, form section

Then organisms: Card lists, ProfilePanel, NavBar

Finally pages and routing

Structure your React app like:

css
Copy
Edit
src/
  components/
    Button/
    Input/
    CardSection/
  pages/
    Dashboard/
    Profile/
  App.tsx
  theme/
    index.ts (Canvax theme overrides if needed)
5. Use Canvax Starter Kits & Patterns
Canvax may have available boilerplate/starter templates for layout and authentication patterns (check Scotiabank internal GitHub or Bitbucket). Use those as a scaffold.

If not:

Use MUI (Material UI) as base, since Canvax extends MUI.

Apply Canvax theme via ThemeProvider if available.

tsx
Copy
Edit
import { ThemeProvider } from '@scotiabank/canvax';
import { CssBaseline } from '@mui/material';

<ThemeProvider>
  <CssBaseline />
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>
6. Use Screen Grab + Overlay Comparison Tools
Use tools like:

üì∏ PixelSnap / PerfectPixel Chrome Extension: to overlay screenshot with your React result

üß© Measure for Figma (if you later get Inspect access)
